An encrypted storage utility for the command line
Created by Hanna Rose <me@hanna.lol>

usage: veil [options] <command>

init                  Initialize a new identity.
lock <path>           Encrypt a file or directory.
unlock <path>         Decrypt a file or directory.

--color=[bool]        Enable or disable colors.
-t, --threads=[int]   Set the number of threads.
-n, --naming=[enum]   Change encrypted naming method.
-h, --help            Show this help message text.
--version             Show the current version.

By default keys are stored in the $XDG_DATA_HOME/veil
folder, however the VEIL_HOME variable can be set to
the path of a directory and that will be used instead.

Color can be enabled or disabled with the use of the 
NO_COLOR, VEIL_COLOR, and TERM environment variables. 
Setting NO_COLOR to any value or setting TERM to the 
value "dumb" will also disable color. You can set 
VEIL_COLOR to toggle color on or off as well.
