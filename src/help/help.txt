--color=[bool]        Enable or disable colors.

Color can also be enabled or disabled with the use
of the NO_COLOR, HYPER_COLOR, and TERM environment
variables. Setting NO_COLOR will disable color, as
well as setting TERM to "dumb" will also disable it.
You can set HYPER_COLOR to force enable color also.
